1 - I use Python 3.9.7, 64bits
	- you need to have installed:
		- https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/	
			->> pip install beautifulsoup4
		- https://pypi.org/project/pandasql/
			->> pip install pandasql
2 - I use: PostgreSQL 13.4, compiled by Visual C++ build 1914, 64-bit as a Database
	->>url: postgresql.org/download/
3 - Once you have installed Postgres DB you need to open and run "schema.sql" file for creating the database and all the necessary tables
4 - I share some .JPG (Diagram and terminal output)
5 - you will find all the required output solutions files attached (.json files and secret.txt file)


Thanks :)
